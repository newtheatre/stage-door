/**
 * Copies Cloudflare Secrets Store values into runtimeConfig at the start of
 * every request.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `0.` PREFIX IS LOAD-BEARING — DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE. Nitro sorts
 * `server/plugins/` with `localeCompare` on the filename and calls their
 * `request` hooks in that order, so this must sort ahead of every other
 * plugin. nuxt-auth-utils memoises its whole session config — password
 * included — on the *first* session read an isolate performs, and keeps it for
 * that isolate's life. A plugin that reads the session before this one has
 * hydrated the password therefore pins the empty default, permanently and
 * silently: h3's `getSession` swallows unseal failures (`.catch(() => {})`),
 * so `/api/_auth/session` still answers 200 with an anonymous `{ id }` and
 * nothing appears in the logs. This is exactly what happened to Proscenium on
 * 2026-08-14, where `authorization-resolver.ts` sorted first.
 *
 * Server middleware is safe — it runs after every plugin `request` hook. It is
 * plugins that need the ordering.
 *
 * `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD` is shared by every app on the estate
 * (docs/session-contract.md), so it lives in the account Secrets Store rather
 * than as four worker secrets that have to be rotated in lockstep. The
 * trade-off is that a Secrets Store binding is an object with an async
 * `get()`, not a string: Nitro's env → runtimeConfig mapping cannot consume
 * one, and nuxt-auth-utils reads `runtimeConfig.session.password`
 * synchronously the first time a session is touched. So the value has to be
 * put there before any handler runs, which is what this plugin does.
 *
 * ⚠️ The binding is deliberately NOT named `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD`. On
 * Workers `process.env` is a proxy over the bindings object, and Nitro's
 * `applyEnv` copies any `NUXT_*` key onto the matching runtimeConfig path — so
 * a NUXT_-prefixed binding would land the *binding object* in
 * `session.password` and break sealing in a thoroughly confusing way. The
 * store-side secret keeps its `NUXT_` name; only the binding drops it. Same
 * rule applies to anything else moved into the store.
 *
 * Scheduled tasks do not go through the request hook. None of ours seal
 * sessions, so nothing is missing today — but a task that needs a
 * store-backed secret must read the binding itself.
 *
 * In dev there is no binding and this is a no-op: the password comes from
 * NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD in `.env` as docs/development.md describes.
