# `nuxt db migrate` has no dry-run, so this stands in for one. It is also the
# gate the migrate workflow runs *after* applying, because the CLI cannot be
# trusted to fail loudly on its own: `nuxt db migrate` exits 0 even when the
# migration errored (the `nuxt db` proxy swallows the code: `nuxt-db migrate`
# is the invocation that propagates it, and the workflow uses that). Checking
# the ledger afterwards is the only version-independent proof that the work
# actually landed.
#
# Both ledger spellings are folded together: `nuxt db migrate` records
# `0016_lying_maverick` and `wrangler d1 migrations apply` records
# `0016_lying_maverick.sql`, and production carries both for every migration so
# far. See docs/08-operations.md §5.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ledger read (output may be empty), 2 = could not read it.
